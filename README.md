## üé¨ How a Clueless Movie Night Became a Data Obsession

"It all started when I watched that F1 movie on a whim. As the credits rolled in the theater, I hit my friends with:

üî• "Why was everyone so angry about tires? Are they that expensive?"

üö¶ "WHY is he balancing this much weight on his HEAD in training video?!"

üèéÔ∏è "Wait, why there are 2 players?"

The next morning, 

Instagram decided I was now an F1 fan. Between suggested reels of pit stop fails and conspiracy theories about the 2021 finale,I:

1) Googled "F1 datasets" like someone who suddenly thinks they're Ross Brawn
2) Found toUpperCase78's treasure trove of race data
3) When they finally fed-up ("Please just make a dashboard instead"), this project was born - proof that peer pressure can sometimes yield productive results."


üìå "Things I Learned the Hard Way"

"No, you can't just average lap times and call it a day"
"Pandas hates DNF values as much as Ferrari hates strategy calls"

### Project Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive statistical overview of Max Verstappen's Formula 1 career. By loading and processing race, qualifying, and driver data, it quantifies his achievements, identifies trends over different seasons, and evaluates his performance across various circuits. The analysis includes:

1) Overall Career Statistics: Total wins, podiums, pole positions, and fastest laps.
2) Seasonal Performance: Breakdown of wins, points, and qualifying results per season.
3) Car Performance: Wins associated with different Red Bull car models.
4) Track Analysis: Performance metrics (wins, podiums, average position) for each circuit, categorized by circuit type.
5) Position Changes: Analysis of starting grid vs. finishing position to assess race craft.

### Features
1) Automated Data Loading: Fetches F1 race, qualifying, and driver data directly from a GitHub repository for seasons 2015-2025.
2) Robust Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, converts various position and time formats to numerical values, and standardizes team names.
3) Max Verstappen Specific Filtering: Extracts and focuses the analysis solely on Max Verstappen's performance data.
4) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Calculates and presents essential metrics such as win rates, podium rates, and average points.
5) Career and Track Summaries: Generates detailed dataframes summarizing annual performance and track-specific results.
6) Informative Visualizations: Creates a series of plots to visually represent trends in wins, qualifying, race finishes, points, and track performance.
7) Output to CSV: Saves cleaned data and summary reports to CSV files for further external analysis or record-keeping.

### Data Sources
1) The data used in this project is sourced from the toUpperCase78/formula1-datasets GitHub repository, which contains various F1 season data in CSV format.
2) Race Results: formula1_[season]season_raceResults.csv

### Setup and Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries installed:
1) pandas
2) requests
3) matplotlib
4) seaborn

1) You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas requests matplotlib seaborn Usage

2) Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Run the Python Script:
Execute the max_verstappen_f1_analysis.py script.

3) python max_verstappen_f1_analysis.py
The script will automatically download the necessary data, perform the analysis, generate plots, and save the results to CSV files in the same directory. The plots will be displayed sequentially.

### Analysis Highlights
The script provides a summary of Max Verstappen's performance directly in the console output.

1) Max Verstappen Performance Summary (2015-2025):

Total Races: 151

Wins: 60

Podiums: 95

Pole Positions: 34

Fastest Laps: 13 

2) Career Performance Summary (2015-2025):

A table showing annual performance including Wins, Podiums, Win Rate, Podium Rate, and Total Points for each year, along with the Team and Car used.

3) Track Performance Summary:

A table showing top tracks where Verstappen has raced at least 3 times, sorted by Win Rate, including Races, Wins, Podiums, Average Position, and Circuit Type.

4) Visualizations
The script generates several plots to illustrate Verstappen's performance:

* Wins by Season: A bar chart showing the number of wins each season.
* Qualifying Positions by Season: A stacked bar chart illustrating the distribution of qualifying positions across seasons.
* Race Finish Position Distribution: A box plot showing the distribution of his race finishing positions per season.
* Total Points by Season: A line chart displaying his points accumulation over the years.
* Verstappen's Wins by Year and Car Model: A bar chart breaking down wins by season and the specific car model used.
* Best and Worst Tracks by Win Rate: A bar chart highlighting circuits where he has a high or low win rate (minimum 3 races).
* Starting Grid vs Finishing Position: A scatter plot showing how his starting position correlates with his finishing position, with a diagonal line indicating no change.
* verstappen's Win Rate by Track and Circuit Type: A heatmap showing win rates categorized by track and their circuit characteristics.

### Output Files
The following CSV files are generated upon successful execution:

1) verstappen_race_results_2015-2025.csv
2) verstappen_qualifying_results_2015-2025.csv
3) verstappen_career_summary_2015_2025.csv
4) verstappen_track_performance_detailed.csv

### Power BI Reports
The project also includes a Power BI dashboard, built using DAX, which offers an interactive way to explore Max Verstappen's performance.

This dashboard provides:

1) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): At-a-glance metrics for wins, fastest laps, poles, podiums, total races, and current car model.
2) Seasonal Insights: Visualizations of wins per season broken down by car model, and a trend of championship points per season.
3) Interactive Slicers: A 'Season' slicer allows for dynamic filtering of all visuals to focus on specific years.
4) The DAX measures powering this dashboard enable flexible and accurate aggregation of data, providing real-time insights as filters are applied.

DAX comments:

1) DAX: DISTINCTCOUNT( 'YourTable'[Team] )
2) "Fastest Laps - 13":
   DAX: CALCULATE( COUNTROWS( 'YourTable' ), 'YourTable'[Fastest Lap] = "Yes" ) or SUM( 'YourTable'[IsFastestLap] ) if you have a boolean column.
3) "Total Wins - 60":
   DAX: CALCULATE( COUNTROWS( 'YourTable' ), 'YourTable'[Position] = 1 )
4) "Poles - 34":
   DAX: CALCULATE( COUNTROWS( 'YourTable' ), 'YourTable'[Qualifying Position] = 1 ) (assuming you have a qualifying table/column).
5) "Podium - 95":
   DAX: CALCULATE( COUNTROWS( 'YourTable' ), 'YourTable'[Position] <= 3 )
6) "Total Races by Max - 138":
   DAX: COUNTROWS( 'YourTable' ) (after filtering for Max Verstappen).
7) "RB21": This looks like a Dynamic Title or a card showing the most recent car model.
   DAX: LASTNONBLANKVALUE( 'YourTable'[Car Model], TRUE() ) or MAX( 'YourTable'[Car Model] ) if sorted by season, or a more complex measure to get the car for the most recent selected season.
8) Bottom Row (Charts and Slicers):

"Wins by Season" (Bar Chart):

X-axis: Season (from your date table or race results table).

Y-axis: [Total Wins] measure from above.

Legend/Color: Car Model or Team (the numbers like RB15, RB16, RB18, RB19, RB20, RB21 are car models).

DAX for Labels (e.g., 3 RB15): This would likely be a measure combining the count of wins and the car model, or simply using Car Model as a secondary category or tooltip. For exact labels like that on the bars, you might be using a combination of "Data Labels" features in Power BI and potentially a custom measure that concatenates the win count with the car model for the label.

9) "Season" (Slicer):

10) Field: Season (from your date or race results table).

This allows users to filter the dashboard by year.

11) "Campionship Points by Season" (Line Chart):

X-axis: Season.

Y-axis: Average of Points.

DAX for Average of Points: AVERAGE( 'YourTable'[Points] ) (This seems like average per race or average of final championship points per season. Given the scale, it's likely total points per season, and "Average of Points" might be a mislabeling or referring to how the line chart calculates its aggregate if there are multiple point entries per season). If it's total points, it would be SUM( 'YourTable'[Points] ). A championship points visual would typically sum points per season. The graph shows a sum trend, so SUM('YourTable'[Points]) is more probable.
